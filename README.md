# 💻 Chemical Plant Monitoring Database

Hi! I'm learning SQL and how to integrate it with Python. I wanted to share it here.  
This is my first GitHub project, and I'm excited to start building my portfolio as a data analyst with a focus on the chemical industry. 🚀

---

This project simulates an environmental and operational monitoring database for chemical plants, using Python and SQLite. 
The database is generated with fictitious data on production, emissions, energy and incidents, covering the years 2021 to 2024.

## 🛠️ Technologies involved

- Python 3
- Standard libraries: `sqlite3`, `random`, `datetime`

## 📂 Functionality

Creates the `chemical_plant_monitoring.db` database.
- Automatically generates and inserts simulated data, even if the database already exists.
- Includes tables with:
      - Information on chemical plants and products
      - Monthly production by plant and product
      - Pollutant emissions
      - Energy consumption
      - Industrial incidents
  
## 🧪 How to execute

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/chemical-plant-monitoring.git
   cd chemical-plant-monitoring
